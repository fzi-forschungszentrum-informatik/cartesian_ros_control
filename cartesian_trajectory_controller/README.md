# Cartesian Trajectory Controller
A simple Cartesian trajectory controller that uses the new Cartesian trajectory definition.

## Rationale
This controller shall get you started with executing Cartesian trajectories on your robot.
It implements a simple action server for `FollowCartesianTrajectory`. There are currently two ways of execution, depending on the interface provided by the robot.

The table below highlights possible applications.

| Hardware interface | Primary application |
| -------- | -------- |
| ``PoseCommandInterface``    | You want spline interpolation in ROS but the OEMs driver to take care of inverse kinematics (IK). This variant requires the new Cartesian interfaces.
| ``PositionJointInterface``     | You want spline interpolation in ROS and implement your own IK solver. The provided example uses the established Weighted Levenberg-Marquardt solver form KDL. This variant is compatible with current ROS-control so that you need not change your RobotHW abstraction.


## Controller .yaml
An example config for the Universal Robots UR10 looks like this:
```yaml
# This controller uses a Cartesian pose interface for control.
# Inverse Kinematics is handled by the robot itself.
pose_cartesian_traj_controller:
    type: "pose_controllers/CartesianTrajectoryController"

    # This type uses the names according to UR driver convention.
    # They need not neccessarily exist in the robot_description
    # and are only used to get the correct control handle from the
    # hardware interface.
    base: "base"
    tip: "tool0_controller"

    joints:
       - shoulder_pan_joint
       - shoulder_lift_joint
       - elbow_joint
       - wrist_1_joint
       - wrist_2_joint
       - wrist_3_joint

# This controller uses a joint position interface for control.
# Inverse Kinematics is handled by the controller.
jnt_cartesian_traj_controller:
    type: "position_controllers/CartesianTrajectoryController"

    # This type requires valid URDF links and they are used to
    # set-up an internal kinematics chain. Make sure that they correspond to the drivers' frames.
    # In this case, tool0 and tool0_controller are identical, but the latter
    # one does not exist in the URDF description.
    base: "base"
    tip: "tool0"

    joints:
       - shoulder_pan_joint
       - shoulder_lift_joint
       - elbow_joint
       - wrist_1_joint
       - wrist_2_joint
       - wrist_3_joint

```

## Customizing Inverse Kinematics

Plugins allow you to implement your own (possibly more advanced) Inverse Kinematics algorithm. For instance, you may wish
to use additional sensors in your environment and react online to objects and collisions.

Take a look at the provided *example_solver* on how to use the plugin mechanism for your custom implementation.
You can then specify the *ik_solver* at startup in form of a controller-local parameter in the .yaml controller config file:

```yaml
jnt_cartesian_traj_controller:
     type: "position_controllers/CartesianTrajectoryController"
     ik_solver: "example_solver"
     ...

```
